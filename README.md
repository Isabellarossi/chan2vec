# chan2vec

The methods and experiment results are described in the following paper:
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09892

Directions for running experiments from the paper and generating the https://transparency.tube/ channel classifications data are below.

## Political Channel Discovery

Commands from the following docs were used for political channel discovery (some data of which is used in Dinkov experiments)

1. Find candidate channels:
- experiments/docs/political_channel_discovery_init_round.txt
- experiments/docs/political_channel_discovery_round1.txt
- experiments/docs/political_channel_discovery_round2.txt
- experiments/docs/political_channel_discovery_round3.txt

2. Final political channel classification, out-of-sample performance stats, and language prediction stats
- experiments/docs/channel_language_prediction.txt
- experiments/docs/political_channel_classification_knn_only.txt

3. Channel discovery hold out analysis
- experiments/docs/political_channel_classification_coverage_analysis.txt

Note, for data collections, all scripts that require --ec2-ip-fp must have a file with the IPs of AWS instances that have been launched.
An example can be found here: data_collection/configs/comment_scrape_instances.SAMPLE.txt


## Dinkov Media Bias / Fact Check Experiment

The results of comparing chan2vec to Dinkov's model can be generated by running commands in the following doc
- experiments/docs/dinkov_political_preds.txt

Note, the Dinkov predictions were generated by modifying their code so that they would output predictions for individual channels.


## Soft Tag Predictions

Experiment results and commands for scoring all out of sample are in this doc:
- experiments/docs/political_soft_tags.txt


## Newly Discovered Political Channel Traffic Analysis

Experiment results can be found here:
- experiments/docs/political_soft_tags_traffic_analysis.txt
- experiments/docs/political_soft_tags_traffic_analysis_trends.txt

## Transparency.tube Data

The latest data was generated using commands in the following doc:
- experiments/docs/latest_site_data_20201006.txt

Tag definitions can be found here:

Political lean metrics from hold-one-out cross validation:
| Political Lean | # Channels | Precision | Recall |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Left | 263 | 0.891 | 0.779 |
| Center | 236 | 0.633 | 0.644 |
| Right | 415 | 0.863 | 0.923 |


The predictions are available here:
- data/site_preds/labels_20201006/all_political_soft_tags_20201006.txt

Columns are:
- Channel ID
- Probability the channel is political (all over 0.8)
- Soft tag or political lean
- Probability of soft tag or political lean (use threshold of 0.5)
