# Political Channel Discovery

Commands from the following docs were used for political channel discovery (some data of which is used in Dinkov experiments)

1. Find candidate channels:
- experiments/docs/political_channel_discovery_init_round.txt
- experiments/docs/political_channel_discovery_round1.txt
- experiments/docs/political_channel_discovery_round2.txt
- experiments/docs/political_channel_discovery_round3.txt

2. Final political channel classification, out-of-sample performance stats, and language prediction stats
- experiments/docs/channel_language_prediction.txt
- experiments/docs/political_channel_classification_knn_only.txt

Note, for data collections, all scripts that require --ec2-ip-fp must have a file with the IPs of AWS instances that have been launched.
An example can be found here: data_collection/configs/comment_scrape_instances.SAMPLE.txt


# Dinkov Media Bias / Fact Check Experiment

The results of comparing chan2vec to Dinkov's model can be generated by running commands in the following doc
- experiments/docs/dinkov_political_preds.txt

Note, the Dinkov predictions were generated by modifying their code so that they would output predictions for individual channels.
